# [pilvivayla-basaari](https://github.com/koulutuksenpilvivayla/pilvivayla-basaari) development environment

To start developing pilvivayla-basaari project, you can use this Vagrant box and ansible playbooks to setup isolated development environment.

## Requirements

These components needs to be installed to your host machine (computer that youâ€™re using for development):

* Virtualbox (v. 4.1.12 or higher)
* Vagrant (v. 1.6.3 or higher)
* pip (v. 1.0 or higher)
* Ansible (v. 1.7 or higher)

For Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
* Virtualbox 4.3.10_Ubuntur93012 (sudo apt-get install virtualbox)
* Vagrant 1.6.3 ( https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/vagrant/vagrant_1.6.3_x86_64.deb)
* Ansible 1.7.1 (sudo pip install ansible)

# Usage

## First time usage

To setup vagrantbox to your host machine, clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/koulutuksenpilvivayla/pilvivayla-provisioning.git`

Run command from the repository root `./install.sh`
The script will check that every requirements are satisfied.

If you get message

`Basaar is successfully installed. To run server login to
vagrant box using 'vagrant ssh' command and run command
/home/vagrant/basaar/sites/basaar/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
Source code is located in host machine /mnt/basaar, you can use that
with your favourite IDE. :-)`

then your development environment is setup correctly.

## Normal usage

If you already have installed the development environment, you can just cd to the repository where Vagrantfile is located and run command: `vagrant up`

Vagrant commands:
* vagrant up (starts the virtual environment)
* vagrant halt (stops the virtual environment)
* vagrant reload (restarts the virtual environment)
* vagrant ssh (access to virtual environemnt with ssh)

# Start django server from virtual environment

After you have installed and the vagrant box is running (`vagrant up` command) you can access to it with `vagrant ssh` command. When you're inside vagrant box, run `/home/vagrant/basaar/sites/basaar/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000` command. Then you can open browser from host machine and access to basaar application with url [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

# Source code

After the installation, you can use favourite IDE/editor from your host machine. Source code is located on /mnt/basaar in your host machine.

# Git

After instalation, please change git settings from /mnt/basaar/.git to use your github credentials or SSH.
