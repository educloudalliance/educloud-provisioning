# [pilvivayla-basaari](https://github.com/koulutuksenpilvivayla/pilvivayla-basaari) development environment

To start developing pilvivayla-basaari project, you can use this Vagrant box and ansible playbooks to setup isolated development environment.

## Requirements

These components needs to be installed to your host machine (computer that youâ€™re using for development):

* Virtualbox (v. 4.1.12 or higher)
* Vagrant (v. 1.6.3 or higher)
* pip (v. 1.0 or higher)
* Ansible (v. 1.7 or higher)

vagrant box using 'vagrant ssh' command and run command
/home/vagrant/basaar/sites/basaar/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
